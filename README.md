### EXTERNAL VIDEO SUPPORT
- Starting v1.6, the following path can be used to playback an external video
`/sdcard/Movies/NRFParis2025.mp4`
- adb can be used to upload the file:
  `adb push "C:\Users\...your..path...\NRFParis2025.mp4" /sdcard/Movies`
- If no valid file is found at that location, internal videos are played back
